Intent Classification Using ATIS Dataset. 

This project focused on creating a intent classification model that can be used for Airline Chatbots. 

Method :
The text and labels are preprocessed, tokenized and encoded as integers. The values are then padded to standardize the length of each input. 
Using GloVe word embeddings we are able to create a matrix of the text vocbulary and their semantic relationships, this matrix is then fed into our
CNN as the emedding layer.

Using this method we achieved accuracy score of 98% !
